# Where to put your theme:

Themes are stored in the `themes/` subdirectory under the Zed config:

```bash
~/.config/zed/themes
```

Each theme file can contain multiple themes—such as light and dark variants—under the same theme family.

Add a theme (in this case: `whaletheme-zed.json`) file to the `themes` directory and it will be available in the theme selector the next time Zed loads.
